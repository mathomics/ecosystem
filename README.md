# ecosystem
Supplementary material "The abundance-growth space determines relevant metabolic phenotypes of a community."
- S1: Model curation for _A. ferrooxidans_ and _S. thermosulfidooxidans_
- S2: Models _A. ferrooxidans_ Wenelen (iML510) and _S. thermosulfidooxidans_ Cutipay (iSM517)
- sup_mat_multiple_bioleaching includes analysis of multiple scenarios simultaneously from previously computed results stored on the folder result_files
- sup_toy_example includes an analysis that can be performed locally and its associated plots
- simulations_pareto4.csv is a csv file including all available simulations
- full_ecosystem: is the class of the ecosystem object
- multiple_ecosystem: is the class of the ecosystem object optimized for multiple analysis (no model is loaded for each scenario, only grid and results)
